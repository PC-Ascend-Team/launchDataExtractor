# launchDataExtractor
Takes in a text file full of comma delimited data and extracts user defined positions. Compile on your system and run.



Here's a small tool I just we can use for sorting out our launch data into unique files however we need that Oliver advised me would benefit us. To run this, compile the cpp file on something like codeblocks or your favorite c++ compiler and run the program to enter info about the data you're extracting into the program. If you switch the branch to "luapsTests" you'll see my test folder I made showing a few instances of using the tool and how it behaves. Try it out! To use this in the real world the actual launch data would need to be renamed to "rawData" without an extension, that's what the program is expecting.
